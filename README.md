### Hi Leon 👋

I'm an PhD student at Helmholtz Munich and TUM focus. 
<!--
If you are looking for opportunities for a position as PhD student, postdoc, research engineer, research assistant, or an internship, Bachelor or Master’s thesis, have a look at my past work and student projects and ping me if you’re interested in working with me.

Interested in AI communication? I am also co-founder of KI macht Schule, a non-profit organization teaching ML basics to high-school students. We provide teachers with modern teaching software and are the first German company to offer fully German-hosted LLMs for education purposes.

I am also co-founder and CTO of Kinematik AI, a company offering customized machine vision and multi-modal learning systems.
